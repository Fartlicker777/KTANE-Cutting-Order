  description: "You ever wonder why the people who make these bombs also make a way
    to disarm them? If you want to cause destruction, you might as well leave out
    the safety mechanism.\n\nCut the wires in order based on a combination of both
    their colors and positions.\n\nThe manual can be found in the manuals folder of
    the game or at ktane.timwi.de.\n\r\nContact Fartlicker777#9169 on Discord if there
    are any bugs."
